- One: All in One Solutions
  - What are they?
    - Direct and effortless solutions problems
    - Provides an immediate solution to a problem
  <!--NOTE: Maybe preface some statements with "could it be" like "Could it be that we want to cut complexity?" mull it over -->
  - Why do we believe? What are we searching for?
    - We are problem solvers
      - It's in our DNA
      - We want to resolve issues then move onto the next
    - We want to cut complexity
      - Have Less moving parts
      - Encapsulated functionality so everything is black boxed
      - Eliminate unnecessary code or infrastructure run lean
  - Ultimately Collapse Everything in manageable bits
  - Life is "Easier"
    - What does "Easier" mean? It really translates to:
      - Refocusing our Time on other priorities or interests
      - Reallocate our:
        - People enable them to work on projects that inspire them
        - Efforts focus on innovative initiatives
        - Budgets invest on initiatives that matter
      - Effortlessly meeting deadlines and target goals with minimum friction
      - Basically an awesome technology utopia
      - A Nerf Gun battle, D&D, Cosplay nirvana
  - Ok now let's Pump the Breaks and focus on reality people
    - The reality is Software is:
      - Very complicated
        - There are lots of moving parts
        - Black boxes are very helpful if they're well designed... the reality that they're not
        - Unnecessary code is very difficult to purge
          - Raise your hand if you have ever eliminated code only to find that your change broke a critical service and you had to quickly reinstate that code to resolve the issue?
          - Legacy code is like cockroaches... very hard to get rid of
    - 
- Two: Impact
          - We're automating and imitating real-world actions, conditions and objects using Zeros, Ones and electricity
